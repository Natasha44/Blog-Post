        <h3><a id="welcome-to-github-pages" class="anchor" href="#welcome-to-github-pages" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Introduction</h3>
        <p>“Everyone get into teams”. This is probably the most dreaded sentence for a student to hear. Teamwork is such an important aspect when it comes to the real world yet no one ever wants to work in one. “I’m going to have to do all the work”, or “this project is going to ruin my GPA” are common things students will say to themselves about group work. Over the last 8 months I have been apart of one of the biggest projects I’ve had in a school environment, working with one of the biggest teams I have ever worked with. It really opened my eyes up to some of the different situations you run into working with a team. Some were negative but there were a lot of positives that came with it as well.</p>

        <h3><a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Difficulties of Working in Teams</h3>
        <p>At times, working with a team can be extremely difficult. Even though I was not the biggest fan of teamwork, these issues became more apparent working with a team and a project of this scale. To start off, it is difficult in a school environment to set up meetings and such when everyone has a different schedule then you. This was an issue for us last semester as one group member was only there once a week. This semester, was once again, also an issue to schedule a meeting time as the only days where everyone was at the school, there was bound to be someone with another class during the times we were planning to meet. Another thing that was difficult in a team environment was code standards. Every person in the group had their own way of coding and when we put all the code together, it became a bit of a mess. Sometimes it even took longer to figure out what someone was doing in his or her code because of the different coding standards. Luckily we figured this out quickly and had a meeting about what code standards we are going to use from that point on. For this project in particular, starting off on the right foot took a while. We were all new to using AngularJS as only one person on our team had experience with it. It took awhile for everyone to learn and understand AngularJS and because of the learning process and different levels of learning, it took us about a month for everyone to get started on some work. Even after this month, we still had to tweak a couple of things before most people were sure of what they were doing. I was in a group where everything was done on time but since we were all working on our stories at different times, it was difficult to ask for help from someone working on the project at the same time as you. This often required waiting for someone to start working on it or someone else having to start to work on it in order to help you. Along with this point, a lot of the stories weren’t completed until the night before the sprint so the project manager was stressed out sprint day because of all the merge conflicts and broken code caused by the merge conflicts that had to be working before the sprint. This could have been avoided if we had smaller stories to be done 2 days before the sprint and the larger pieces the day before. One of the most surprising difficulties to me was keeping up with the task board, pivotal tracker, and our burn down chart. When we first got the project requirements, I thought that these tasks would be easy. As soon as a story is done, you go and update all three. No big deal. However, that wasn’t the case at all. We had a lot of difficulty keeping these three things up to date as people would finish their story and consider all that they needed to do done. Everyone on the team at times were forgetting that we had the task board, the burn down chart, and pivotal tracker to update as well. This would become extremely frustrating at times because it was such an easy and quick task to take care of. The most frustrating part about working in a team was the different work efforts people were giving. There’s the saying that you’re only as strong as your weakest member so when you’re putting in 100% into your work and there is someone else who is only putting in about 50%, it becomes very frustrating as it doesn’t come together as nicely in the final project. "With some teams, there can be a tendency for members to sit back and let others do most of the work. This can cause resentment in the workplace, especially if you as a business owner recognize only the efforts of the team and not those of its leaders. Conflict may occur as a result, which can have a detrimental effect on workplace morale." (C. Joseph). Other people then have to come in and pick up the slack. The team I was with for the most part was really good at giving 100% into their work and for the times that someone didn’t, someone else in the team would go in and fix it to the quality we were all expecting.</p>

        <h3><a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Benefits of Working in Teams</h3>
        <p>Even though there were some difficulties working with a team, there were also a lot of positives that came along with it. We all had our own stories so instead of spending 20 hours a week in order to get the work done, each of us only had to spend about 2 hours a week in order to get the same amount of work done. This in turn gave all of us more time to work on other things. The ideas and problems you can solve when you’re with a team versus by yourself are remarkably better as well. You have people coming up with more creative solutions that you would have never thought of. As well as coming up with point of views you would have never thought of. One example of this was deciding how a student will cancel a job that they have already accepted to. It came up that we shouldn’t have this functionality at all. The reason behind this was we intentionally want to make it difficult for a student to cancel a job so that at the last minute, they can’t just go in and cancel a job leaving the employer short staffed because the student decided they wanted to go out partying. This was a perspective that I never even thought of but when it was said, it made a lot of sense to make it difficult to cancel. "By having employees with different backgrounds and perspectives discussing the pros and cons of alternative solutions, the best possible solution tends to win out. Moreover, team members can collaborate to enhance the benefits of the best solution by continuing to work together to enact it". (C. Joseph). The best thing about working in teams is the people you meet and the friendships that develop through out the process. Even though we had our ups and downs throughout the process, in the end we are still a team and we look out for each other no matter what. We teach each other knew things and we learn from each other through every step of the way.</p>

        <h3><a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>I know that everyone dreads when someone says we have to work on something as a team. Maybe if we start looking at team work as a positive experience instead of a negative one, team work will start actually becoming more of a positive experience instead of a negative one that a lot of us are us to. I realize that it can be hard if people don’t put in the same effort as you and the quality isn’t as good as you would have hoped. Unfortunately, you are going to run into the same thing in the real world in regards to this as you are in a classroom setting. Instead of complaining about it, figure out a way to deal with it. Once you work with a team for a long enough time, you can establish the quality of work you want and once you get everyone on the same page of how things need to be done, doing work in teams can lead to something better then what you originally expected. Let’s face it, it is very rare that when you get a job that you are going to be working on one project by yourself. Most jobs these days require you to work with a team. These last 8 months have really been an experience for me and help me become aware of the challenges that come with group work but also help me develop the skills in which to deal with these challenges. This process also helped me become aware about how positive working with a team can be and the true benefits there are while working on a team project for more then one month. Previously, I looked at teamwork as nothing but a negative experience. I’d have to do all the work or the quality wouldn’t be as good. However, I realized that once you start getting organized as a team and helping each other, the work starts becoming less and less work every week while the quality continues to increase. This was an eye opening experience as to what I can expect when I start a new job. I now know what to expect when it comes to teams and how to deal with the different challenges that may come my way. This was a great experience for me that showed me the potential that working in teams can have.</p>
